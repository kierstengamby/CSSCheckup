    <ul>
        <li><b>Recycle: </b> make sure you check with your local recycling plant to see which items can be recycled in your area.</li>
        <li><b>Conserve water: </b> when you're not using it, turn off the tap.</li>
        <li><b>Unplug your electronics:</b> only leave chords plugged in when you are actively charging something.</li>
        <li><b>Plant a tree: </b>to help with the overall ecosystem and stop deforestation.</li>
